*
* Position of dipole relative to Sun center. 
* X axis is LOS is phi=0
* Z axis is theta=0
* Y axis is phi=90
* r (solar radii) theta phi (degrees)
0.95 90. 90. 
* Orientation of dipole, projections on to (x,y,z) frame.
* Note that x is LOS, and x=0 defines the plane of sky
* xm ym zm  
* coords are binary and give direction for each axis, 100 is oriented alonx x axis, 001 si perpendicular to the limb and projected along z. 011 is inclined 45 degrees between the y and z axis

* alpha dalpha p dp: alpha is the scalar potential value,
*                    dalpha measures the "thickness" of constant alpha shell
*                    p the azimuthal angle.
