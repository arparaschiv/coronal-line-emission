* Position of dipole relative to Sun center. X axis is LOS is phi=0
* Z axis is theta=0
* r (solar radii) theta phi (degrees)
0.9 90. 90.

* Orientation of dipole, projections on to (x,y,z) frame.
* Note that x is LOS, and x=0 defines the plane of sky

* strength of dipole (dipole moment).  This yields strength of the 
* magnetic field (it is used to derive the potential whose
* grad yields vector magnetic field

* Delta: dx dy dz for evaluation of vector grad
1.e-4 
* BASE- base electron density

* alpha dalpha p dp: alpha is the scalar potential value,
*                    p the azimuthal angle. 
*                    dalpha measures the "thickness" of constant alpha shell
*                    dp measures the thickness in azimuthal direction
