BUG June 6 2019 PGJ 

gammae.f, gammai.f, gammas.f

	  Incorrect denominators (2*AA1+1) in two places have been corrected in this routines.
	  Thanks to Tom Schad for noting tpart of this problem.

	  Sum over multipole order K was incorrectly done from -K to K. Now the do loop
	  is DO M=0,K,2    This error led to an overestimate of collisional rates through
	  a sum over CASSUME (for strong coupling and exchange collisions only).

colrd.f gammai.f gammas.f 

 	  Cases of spin-forbidden lines are now treated in the same way as M1
	  transitions by assuming that the cross-sections are dominated by strog
	  coupling and/or exchange of electrons.


EFFECTS: In some ways these two sets of changes comepnsate for one
another for calculations ehich include spin-changing or delta J > 1
collisions. For small atomic models with no such transitions the revised
code will produce smaller collision rates, by factors of two or so.
For those atoms constructed to take care of collisions via allowed
E1 transitions, these changes are exected to be small.


IMPROVEMENT June 6 2019 PGJ

colrd.f gammae.f, gammai.f, gammas.f

	Added a key ICOLLMM which flags if sums over M to M' collisions are
	needed.  This can speed up collision calculations by skipping loops
	in the gamma*f routines.

BUG 16 Jan 2014  PGJ

gammae.f - incorrect implementation of CECOEFF has been replaced
	 with a reduction in J^2_0 in the routine field_int.f

	 Note that this led to inconsistent statistical equilibrium calculations
	 when collisions were included and when CECOEF in the INPUT file was non-zero.
