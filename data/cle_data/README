December 21, 2012 updated PGJ, Fe11 added
March 4 2020, updated PGJ, Fe XIII atomic model uses
              CHIANTI v9 revised/corrected data, also
	      includes a 4th level with collisions/
	      branching ratios changed to reproduce a 34
	      level calculation of intensities and P/I
	      atom.fe13.old is the originally released
	      incorrect file.  

files are as follows.

Original (unmodified collisions) files:  

atom.fe10o
atom.fe13o
atom.fe14o
atom.si10o
atom.si9o

Files modified for depolarizing effects of missing collisions
(These have been updated in March 2020 to account for a coding
error in collisions found in 2019):

            CECOEF   WLMIN    WLMAX
*atom.fe10   0.        6360.    6380.
*atom.fe11   1.5e-9    7500    100000 
*atom.fe13   2.e-9    10730    10820
*atom.fe14   0.        5290     5320
*atom.si10   0.8e-9   13000    15000
*atom.si9    5.e-8    39000    40000 

The number after the file name gives the value of CECOEF needed in file
INPUT to account for linear polarization in addition to these data. 

Abundances of 7.6 and 7.52 were used for Iron and Silicon (Allen 1973).
