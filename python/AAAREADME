ingest.py:

	reads output from pca.f into the array S that is
	inputs are pca.dat and the grid is in pca.hdr

	This is then pickled in to the files
	sdata.pkl
	pcagrid.pkl


	The sdata are stokes profiles that can be treated as real data
	and/or test data where the geometry is stored in pcagrid.


process.py

	Generates decomposed data which is stored in 
	pcadata.pkl
	
		- this contains u, sigma, coeff,nc u = principal vectors, sig=diagonals,
		       		   	  	       coeff= projection of all training data on
						       to the eigenvectors, nc = number of significant
						       principal components.


find.py

	find the matches of a given dataset in the PCA database.
